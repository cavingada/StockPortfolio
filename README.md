# StockPortfolio
This project allows users to get historical data on a custom built stock portfolio (with tickers and corresponding shares, a start date, and an end date). A user can retrieve the semi deviation (downwards deviation), monthly volatility, value at risk (95% confidence), and maximum drawdown with regards to their portfolio by calling the respective function.
