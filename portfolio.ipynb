    "    This project allows users to get historical data on a custom built stock portfolio (with tickers\n",
    "    and corresponding shares, a start date, and an end date). A user can retrieve the semi deviation\n",
    "    (downwards deviation), monthly volatility, value at risk (95% confidence), and maximum drawdown \n",
    "    with regards to their portfolio by calling the respective function.  \n",
